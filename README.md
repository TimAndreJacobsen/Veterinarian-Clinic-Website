# Philosophy:
### as few plugins as gets the job done, uses: Advanced Custom Fields, Members, Manual Image Crop, Regenerative Thumbnails.
### Secure: Keeping the site safe from injection attacks, cross-site scripting.
### Auto-deployment: GIT push to production branch hosted privately on GitHub and uses DeployHQ to upload files over SSH with webhooks.
##### Using a private repo for production to hide sensitive database and config files. Public repo is equal to private repo, only with .gitignore for sensitive files.
